## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vuln is something like being able to hide a script from the plugin,
be able to crash the plugin or Roblox Studio, cause lots of lag,
make an error which stops the scan or something else which is minor
consider filing a bug report for it and attach vulnerability tag to it.
If it is more serious DM me on discord ALE111_boiPNG#8154 or PM me on roblox https://www.roblox.com/users/562273354/profile or https://www.roblox.com/users/867730378/profile.
Serious vulns include being able to get a higher context level, be able to destroy the game enviroment(not on runtime),
be able to affect the game enviroment (Not on runtime) etc.
Being able to hide from detection might not usually be considered a vulnerability.
