I've decided to archive this as I'm no longer using this and it's probably not getting updated, I have locally developed this a bit further but I don't think this holds as much value though. You can still use this and I'll probably updated this to the latest version soon.

# Titan-Protection
Titan Protection is a Roblox plugin to remove malicious objects. This is unready and in shared alpha testing.

You can use the plugin on Roblox by either downloading the .rbxmx file from the releases or get direct updates as a user plugin from https://www.roblox.com/library/6185269346/Titan-Protection-Anti-Virus.
